All vim plugins managed by vim-plug, which must be installed separately.

Powerline fonts required for vim-airline to have proper appearance.

```
sudo apt-get install powerline
```

Git

The git config file assumes that there is a file `.signing.gitconfig.inc` with
contents like the following:

```
[user]
        signingkey = <key id>
```
